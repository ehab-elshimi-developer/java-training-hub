# Java Training Hub

## Repository Description

ðŸš€ Java Training Hub â€“ A comprehensive repository containing Java exercises covering Basic Syntax, Control Flow, OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem Solving.

This repository is designed to build a strong foundational understanding of Java, ensuring a well-rounded grasp of its core concepts. The goal is to develop backend development skills by tackling various challenges that simulate real-world scenarios.

## Topics Covered

âœ… Basic Syntax & Variables â€“ Java fundamentals, data types, and operators

âœ… Control Flow â€“ Conditional statements, loops (if/else, loops, switch-case)

âœ… Functions & Recursion â€“ Methods, recursion, and modular programming

âœ… Arrays & Data Structures â€“ Arrays, lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps, and sets

âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction

âœ… Algorithms & Problem Solving â€“ Sorting, searching, recursion, and logic-based challenges

## Problems Covered

### Basic Syntax Problems

* Hello World â€“ Printing the first statement in Java
* Swap Two Numbers â€“ Swapping two variables without a temp variable
* Even or Odd â€“ Checking if a number is even or odd
* Find the Largest Number â€“ Finding the largest among three numbers
* Sum of Digits â€“ Calculating the sum of digits of a number

### Control Flow Problems

* Factorial Calculation â€“ Calculating the factorial using loops
* Prime Number Check â€“ Checking if a number is prime
* Reverse a Number â€“ Reversing the digits of a number
* Fibonacci Series â€“ Printing the Fibonacci sequence up to a limit
* Armstrong Number â€“ Checking if a number is an Armstrong number

## Advanced Topics (Upcoming)

* Recursion & Dynamic Programming â€“ Solving problems using recursion and memoization
* Data Structures Implementation â€“ Implementing Linked Lists, Trees, and HashMaps
* Multi-threading & Concurrency â€“ Understanding Java's threading model
* File Handling & Streams â€“ Working with files and input/output streams

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ehab-elshimi-developer/java-training-hub.git
    ```
2.  Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code)
3.  Run the `MainController` class to execute the solutions

## Future Improvements

* Adding more advanced exercises
* Structuring solutions into modular packages for better organization
* Implementing Unit Tests to validate solutions
